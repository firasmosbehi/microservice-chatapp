# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in some cases (e.g. if you have multiple people working on the same codebase and
#   deploying to different environments), you may want to ignore it:
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is recommended to include poetry.lock in version control,
#   however if you have multiple environments you may choose to ignore it:
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is recommended to include pdm.lock in version control,
#   however if you have multiple environments you may choose to ignore it:
#pdm.lock
#   Relative paths to the project's .venv directory are specified in .pdm-python.
#   It is recommended to include .pdm-python in version control, however if you have
#   multiple environments with different Python versions, you may choose to ignore it:
#pdm-python

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow and github.com/pdm-project/pdm
